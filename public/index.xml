      <description>IntroductionAccording to a survey by CrowdFlower, data scientists spend most of theirtime cleaning and manipulating data rather than mining or modeling them forinsights. As such, it becomes important to have tools that make datamanipulation faster and easier. In today’s post, we introduce you todplyr, a grammar of data manipulation.

      <description>IntroductionR code contain a lot of parentheses in case of a sequence of multiple operations. When you are dealing withcomplex code, it results in nested function calls which are hard to read and maintain. The magrittr package by Stefan Milton Bache provides pipes enabling us to write R code that is readable.
Pipes allow us to clearly express a sequence of multiple operations by:
structuring operations from left to rightavoidingnested function callsintermediate stepsoverwriting of original dataminimizing creation of local variablesPipesIf you are using tidyverse, magrittr will be automatically loaded.</description>

      <description>IntroductionA tibble, or tbl_df, is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don’t change variable names or types, and don’t do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the ninth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to add legend to a plot. In this post, we will learn to add text annotations. There are occassions when you want to display additional information in a plot. This is usually achieved by adding text either inside the plot or on the margins. For example, you might want to label a line/bar or add formulas to better communicate what is shown in the plot.</description>

Packages are fundamental to R. There are approximately 11000 packages available on CRAN or the Comprehensive R Archive Network.
Packages are available for different topics. You should always look for a package before writing code from scratch. In case you have written your own codes for a new analysis or topic, do share it with the R community by converting the code into a package.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the eleventh post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt about dataframes. In this post, we will learn about factors.
create factorsorder levelsspecify labelscheck levelsnumber of levelsCategorical or qualitative data in R is treated as data type factor.
Create Factorsargs(factor)## function (x = character(), levels, labels = levels, exclude = NA, ## ordered = is.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the ninth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt about matrices. In this post, we will learn about lists. Lists are very useful as they are heterogeneous i.e. they can contain different data types. If you remember, vectors and matrices are homogeneous i.e. they can contain only one type of data. If you include different data types, they will all be coerced to the same type.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the ninth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt to create matrices. In this post, we will learn to:
combining matricesindex/subset matricesdissolve matricesAppend DataIn this section, we will learn how to append data to a matrix. There are two functions that can be used for this purpose:
rbind()cbind()cbind will append a new column to the matrix while rbind will append a new row.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the eighth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt to index/subset vectors. In this post, we will learn to create matrices. A matrix is a regular array of data elements, arranged in rows and columns. Matrices in R are homogeneous i.e. they can hold a single type of data. Matrix elements are indexed by specifying the row and column index and the elements of a matrix can filled either by row or column.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the seventh post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt to perform simple operations on vector and handle missing values. In this post, we will learn to index/subset vectors.
Index VectorsOne of the most important steps in data analysis is selecting a subset of data from a bigger data set. Indexing helps in retrieving values individually or a set of values that meet a specific criteria.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the sixth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt to create vectors of different data types. In this post, we will learn to
coerce different data typesperform simple operations on vectorshandle missing dataindex/subset vectorsNaming Vector ElementsIt is possible to name the different elements of a vector. The advantage of naming vector elements is that we can later on use these names to access the elements.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the fifth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt about the basic data types in R. IN this post, we will:
understand the concept of vectorslearn to create vectors of different data typesVectorsVector is the most basic data structure in R. It is a sequence of elements of the same data type. If the elements are of different data types, they will be coerced to a common type that can accommodate all the elements.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the fourth post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt how to create variables in R. In this post, we will learn about the following data types:
numeric/doubleintegercharacterlogicaldate/timeNumericIn R, numbers are represented by the data type numeric. We will first create a variable and assign it a value. Next we will learn a few methods of checking the type of the variable.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the third post in the series Introduction to R. In the previous post, we learnt to install RStudio. In this post, we will learn about variables and data types. You can skip this post, if you have prior experience in any other programming language.
What is a variable?variables are the fundamental elements of any programming languagethey are used to represent values that are likely to changethey reference memory locations that store information/dataLet us use a simple case study to understand variables.</description>

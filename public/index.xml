      <description>IntroductionAccording to a survey by CrowdFlower, data scientists spend most of theirtime cleaning and manipulating data rather than mining or modeling them forinsights. As such, it becomes important to have tools that make datamanipulation faster and easier. In today’s post, we introduce you todplyr, a grammar of data manipulation.

dplyrand readrThe data sets can be downloaded from hereand the codes from here.</description>

      <guid>/2017/12/25/introduction-to-tibbles/</guid>
      <description>IntroductionA tibble, or tbl_df, is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don’t change variable names or types, and don’t do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code.</description>

      <guid>/2017/12/25/readable-code-with-pipes/</guid>
      <description>IntroductionR code contain a lot of parentheses in case of a sequence of multiple operations. When you are dealing withcomplex code, it results in nested function calls which are hard to read and maintain. The magrittr package by Stefan Milton Bache provides pipes enabling us to write R code that is readable.
Pipes allow us to clearly express a sequence of multiple operations by:
structuring operations from left to rightavoidingnested function callsintermediate stepsoverwriting of original dataminimizing creation of local variablesPipesIf you are using tidyverse, magrittr will be automatically loaded.</description>

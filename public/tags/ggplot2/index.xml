      <description>IntroductionThis is the fifth post in the series Elegant Data Visualization with ggplot2. In the previous post, we learnt about aesthetics. In this post, we will learn to:
add title and subtitle to the plotmodify axis labelsmodify axis rangeremove axisformat axisTitle &amp;amp; SubtitleLet us create a simple scatter plot with which we will work in the rest of the post.
ggplot(mtcars) +geom_point(aes(disp, mpg))There are two ways to add title to a plot:</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the fourth post in the series Elegant Data Visualization with ggplot2. In the previous post we learnt about geoms and how we can use them to build different plots. In this post, we will focus on the aesthetics i.e.Â color, shape, size, alpha, line type, line width etc. We can map these to variables or specify values for them. If we want to map the above to variables, we have to specify them within the aes() function.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the third post in the series Elegant Data Visualization with ggplot2. In the previous post, we learnt how to create plots using the qplot() function. In this post, we will create some of the most routinely used plots to explore data using the geom_* functions.
Libraries, Code &amp;amp; DataWe will use the following libraries in this post:
readrggplot2tibbledplyrAll the data sets used in this post can be found here and code can be downloaded from here.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the second post in the series Elegant Data Visualization with ggplot2. In the previous post, we understood the concept of grammar of graphics and even built a bar plot step by step while exploring the different components of a plot/chart. In this post, we willlearn to quickly build a set of plots that are routinely used to explore data.

      <description>IntroductionThis is the first post in the series Elegant Data Visualization with ggplot2. In this post, we will:
understand the philosophy of Grammar of Graphicsexplore different aspects of ggplot2learn to build some of the basic plots regularly used for exploring dataggplot2 is an awesome alternative to base R for data visualization. It is based on The Grammar of Graphics. In this post, we will understand the philosophy behind ggplot2 and learn to build some of the most frequently used plots for visualizing data.</description>

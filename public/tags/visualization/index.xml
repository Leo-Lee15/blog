      <description>IntroductionThis is the fourth post in the series Elegant Data Visualization with ggplot2. In the previous post we learnt about geoms and how we can use them to build different plots. In this post, we will focus on the aesthetics i.e.Â color, shape, size, alpha, line type, line width etc. We can map these to variables or specify values for them. If we want to map the above to variables, we have to specify them within the aes() function.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the third post in the series Elegant Data Visualization with ggplot2. In the previous post, we learnt how to create plots using the qplot() function. In this post, we will create some of the most routinely used plots to explore data using the geom_* functions.

      <description>IntroductionThis is the second post in the series Elegant Data Visualization with ggplot2. In the previous post, we understood the concept of grammar of graphics and even built a bar plot step by step while exploring the different components of a plot/chart. In this post, we willlearn to quickly build a set of plots that are routinely used to explore data.

      <description>IntroductionThis is the tenth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to add text annotations to plots. In this post, we will learn how to combine multiple plots. Often, it is useful to have multiple plots in the same frame as it allows us to get a comprehensive view of a particular variable or compare among different variables. The Graphics package offers two methods to combine multiple plots.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThis is the ninth post in the series Data Visualization With R. In the previous post, we learnt how to add legend to a plot. In this post, we will learn to add text annotations. There are occassions when you want to display additional information in a plot. This is usually achieved by adding text either inside the plot or on the margins. For example, you might want to label a line/bar or add formulas to better communicate what is shown in the plot.</description>
